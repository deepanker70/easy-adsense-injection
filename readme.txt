WordPress plugin to easily insert Google Adsense into your WordPress posts or pages. Supports both manual and automatic ad placement.

== Description ==

This WordPress plugin allows users to inject Google Adsense in a WordPress post or any part of the WordPress theme quickly. Simply add the Adsense code in the plugin settings and use shortcodes or functions to place ads anywhere on your site. You can also use this plugin to add any kind of ads anywhere in a WordPress-based website.

### **Automatic Ad Placement:**
The plugin now supports automatic ad placement, allowing you to effortlessly insert ads:
* Above the header
* Below the post title
* Between paragraphs (configurable after how many paragraphs)
* Below the post content
* Below the footer

This ensures that ads are placed strategically without requiring manual shortcodes or function calls.

### **Manual Ad Placement:**
Use these shortcodes within the post:

* [easy_ad_inject_1]
* [easy_ad_inject_2]
* [easy_ad_inject_3]
* [easy_ad_inject_4]
* [easy_ad_inject_5]

Use these functions to add ads in the theme:

* &lt;?php echo put_wp_ad_1(); ?&gt;
* &lt;?php echo put_wp_ad_2(); ?&gt;
* &lt;?php echo put_wp_ad_3(); ?&gt;
* &lt;?php echo put_wp_ad_4(); ?&gt;
* &lt;?php echo put_wp_ad_5(); ?&gt;

== Installation ==
